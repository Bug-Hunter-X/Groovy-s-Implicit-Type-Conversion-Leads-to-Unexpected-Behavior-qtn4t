# Groovy Implicit Type Conversion Surprise

This example demonstrates a potential pitfall in Groovy related to its flexible type system.  The `myMethod` function is designed to handle String inputs, but due to Groovy's implicit type conversion, it also accepts lists, leading to potentially unexpected results.

The issue is that when passing a list to the function, the list is implicitly converted to its string representation ([A, B, C]) before the function proceeds with its operations.

The solution demonstrates how to use explicit type checking to prevent this unexpected behavior and make the function's behavior more predictable and robust.
